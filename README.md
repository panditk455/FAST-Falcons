# FAST- FALCONS, Advanced Software Design(CS347)

The introduction summarizes the purpose and function of the project we are working on. We want to create a small social media app for the Carleton Students. This website will allow the users from Carleton College to talk with other people who are online and do different activities with them. Users can go to three places: Weitz Center, Sayles Cafe, and the Library. You will also be able to post your favorite song that you are currently listening to.
