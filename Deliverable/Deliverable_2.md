# **Second Group Project Deliverable**

**Summary of project**

The introduction summarizes the purpose and function of the project we are working on. We want to create a small social media app for the Carleton Students. This website will allow the users from Carleton College to talk with other people who are online and do different activities with them. Users can go to three places: Bald Spot, Sayles Cafe, and the Library. You will also be able to post text, chat with random carls, and play mini games.

## **Progress**

Our goals for this group project for Advanced Software Design class are: Learn how to work as a team to design meaningful software that effectively engages users with innovative features and intuitive design. We aim to create a social media platform that not only connects Carleton College students but also provides them with a seamless and enjoyable experience: chatting, posting, sharing music, mini-games, encouraging active participation and interaction within the community.
