# **First Group Project Deliverable**

**Summary of project**

The introduction summarizes the purpose and function of the project we are working on. We want to create a small social media app for the Carleton Students. This website will allow the users from Carleton College to talk with other people who are online and do different activities with them. Users can go to three places: Weitz Center, Sayles Cafe, and the Library. You will also be able to post your favorite song that you are currently listening to.

## **Team Agreement**

Our goals for this group project for Advanced Software Design class are: Learn how to work as a team to design meaningful software that effectively engages users with innovative features and intuitive design. We aim to create a social media platform that not only connects Carleton College students but also provides them with a seamless and enjoyable experience: chatting, posting, sharing music, mini-games, encouraging active participation and interaction within the community.

**Team's Information:**
Communication: We will use Whatsapp groupchat for our main communication. Each person is expected to check project-related messages at least once a day. We expect everybody to respond to messages in 2-3 hours (excluding sleep). We will not send messages about assignments/works Friday night and Saturday night. For urgent things, we will do calls but not at night time (after 10 pm). In addition, we will communicate via text and before class for clarifications and questions as needed.

Coding: We will keep track of who is working on what task by using Github Isssues and Milestones assigning different tasks to different people. We plan to coordinate out-of-class meetings on a week-to-week basis as a whole group to review progress and discuss. We will be respectful of each otherâ€™s time, responding to both logistical and technical questions in a timely manner and being accommodating to schedule changes. Though we plan to code individually, we will be in constant communication about what each of us is working on to avoid two people repeating the same task.

Decisions: Every decision the group makes will be recorded in the group chat as well as in this document on github. we will write what changes we made in our commit message while we push the changes.

In person 5 people Meetings: We will meet in Sayles at 3:30 PM Every Friday. For another meeting, we will find a time when there is something that should be done as soon as possible. Sometimes we will do zoom meetings for quick check ins.

Conflicts:
We will have open discussions to resolve internal team conflicts. Following a possible cooling-off period, we will discuss our own perspectives and try to use a solution-oriented strategy towards any issues that may arise. We will try to find compromises that everyone can at least live with and keep personal concerns out of it, although we believe that none will come up.
